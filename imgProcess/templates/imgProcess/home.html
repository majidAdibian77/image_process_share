    <h2>What is image processing</h2>
    <p>Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, were
        developed in the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
        Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to satellite
        imagery, wire-photo standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and photograph
        enhancement.[2] The cost of processing was fairly high, however, with the computing equipment of that era.

        That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated
        hardware
        became available. Images then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such as television
        standards conversion. As general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over the role of
        dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. With the fast computers
        and signal processors available in the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form of image
        processing and generally, is used because it is not only the most versatile method, but also the cheapest.

        Digital image processing technology for medical applications was inducted into the Space Foundation Space
        Technology
        Hall of Fame in 1994</p>
